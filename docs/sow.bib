title = "Multi-Level Liveness Verification for Face-Voice Biometric Authentication",
abstract = "In this paper we present the details of the multilevel liveness verification (MLLV) framework proposed for realizing a secure face-voice biometric authentication system that can thwart different types of audio and video replay attacks. The proposed MLLV framework based on novel feature extraction and multimodal fusion approaches, uncovers the static and dynamic relationship between voice and face information from speaking faces, and allows multiple levels of security. Experiments with three different speaking corpora VidTIMIT, UCBN and AVOZES shows a significant improvement in system performance in terms of DET curves and equal error rates (EER) for different types of replay and synthesis attacks",
